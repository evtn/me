# evtn.me source code

This is the source code of [evtn.me](https://evtn.me), my website, and at the same time, a more interactive version of my CV (as compared to [PDF version](https://evtn.me/cv)).

It's written in TypeScript with Preact, using Octicons by GitHub and Vite. 

The justification for this stack choice is kinda weak, but I think it's okay as long as website bundle size is less than PDF version size (it is now).

To make it more interesting, I've put a few easter eggs there, some are pretty obvious, some are not. 

## Code quality

This code was written in a short period of time, with little to no design guidelines and undergone many changes in development process. There are probably some minor problems such as redundant code, non-obvious approaches, project structure inconsistencies and just general problems. 

If you want to point out some problem with code, create an issue. Any non-constructive issue would be closed without discussion â€” if you don't have time for constructive points, then I don't have time to hear whatever you will write instead.

If you want to suggest a feature, consider that the design is more or less final.

## Usage
